I need to write a program that creates and manages index files, which will contain a b-tree. I can tell that I will have to implement the index file management and also think of a way to create b-trees in code. I do not have much experience with b-trees in code, so this will be an interesting challenge. There are six commands that will be used: create, insert, search, load, print, and extract. I will implement these one-by-one through the sessions. I will be using Python, as this is the language I am most comfortable with, meaning that I will be able to finish this project most efficiently. My first commit after this will be committing the file to the repo, so that I can have a canvas to start my ideas on.

SESSION START
In this session, I will be adding the index.py file, which I will add the functions onto after I make it. I will declare all of the functions I believe will be necessary, so that I can simply keep adding onto them later. I will write the parameters as well, so that I can know, from the start, what the inputs and outputs will be throughout the program

During this session, I was able to create the file itself and declare the functions I will be filling in later. I added docstrings to the functions themselves so that I can easily understand what to do when the time comes. I decided to go with an object-oriented approach, as this would be most appropriate for a structure with nodes. This will make it much easier to traverse the nodes and carry out the necessary actions. Next, I plan on implementing the functions one-by-one. I will decide which function to implement at the start of the next session.

SESSION START
For this session, I will implement the header class, as it seems to be the easiest to do, since I simply need to figure out the partitioning and make the read/write functions. I aim to complete this by the end of the session.

SESSION END
During this session, I was able to implement the header class. It was not as simple as I thought, as I had to consider the block of memory and where exactly I was placing which piece of information. However, once I understood it, I was able to implement the class effectively. I also added global constants so that these important values can be accessed whenever necessary, regardless of class instance. I will decide which portion to work on next in the next session.
